# Feature: Intelligent Flutter Development Script

## Feature Overview
Create a comprehensive development script that automates the Flutter app deployment, installation, and logging process for iOS devices, providing developers with seamless testing and debugging capabilities.

## Problem Statement
Flutter developers face significant friction when testing apps on physical iOS devices because:
- Manual process of checking app installation status on device
- Inconsistent build and deployment workflows
- Difficulty accessing real-time logs during app navigation
- Time-consuming manual steps for app updates
- No unified script for development lifecycle management
- Lost productivity switching between terminal commands

## Proposed Solution
An intelligent development script that automates:
- Device detection and app installation status checking
- Conditional app installation vs. update logic
- Automated build process with error handling
- Real-time log streaming during app usage
- Environment setup and validation
- Development workflow optimization

## User Stories
- As a Flutter developer, I want to run one command to deploy my app and see logs
- As a developer, I want the script to detect if my app needs installation or just an update
- As a developer, I want to see real-time logs as I navigate through the app
- As a team member, I want consistent deployment across different development environments
- As a developer, I want automatic error handling and recovery suggestions

## Key Components
1. iOS device detection and app status checking
2. Conditional installation vs. update logic
3. Automated Flutter build process
4. Real-time log streaming integration
5. Error handling and recovery mechanisms
6. Environment validation and setup

## Expected Outcomes
- Reduced development setup time by 80%
- Seamless testing workflow for iOS devices
- Improved debugging efficiency with real-time logs
- Consistent development experience across team
- Reduced manual errors in deployment process

## Success Metrics
- Time from script execution to app running with logs
- Reduction in manual deployment steps
- Developer satisfaction with testing workflow
- Frequency of successful automated deployments
- Time saved per development cycle
